# Leetcode Blog/Lesson App

This is a personal blog/lesson app built to document and share solutions to Leetcode problems. The application allows me to create, update, delete, hide, and unhide posts. These posts serve as a record of how I approach problems, providing future reference for myself and learning resources for others.

## Features

- **Create, Update, and Delete Posts** – Full CRUD functionality for managing lessons.
- **Hide/Unhide Posts** – Control the visibility of each post.
- **Authentication** – Secure login to access post management features.
- **Public Access** – Anyone can view visible lessons without logging in.

## Purpose Behind the App

I created this app to:
- Document my problem-solving journey on Leetcode.
- Help me review and refresh concepts I’ve previously solved.
- Share my learning process with others who might find it helpful.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Backend & Auth:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Future Improvements
- Filtering posts by topic or difficulty  
- Search functionality
- Code syntax highlighting for better readability
- Create lessons/posts with more control over formatting, including:
  - Bold/italic text within paragraphs
  - Bullet points with nested bullet points
  - Numbered lists
